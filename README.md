examShare
=========

exam sharing web app

- exams indexed/sorted by classes, year, quarter, professor, score
- try to create distrobutions for each exam
- syncs with [teacher](https://github.com/lowellbander/teacher) so that you can see what exams were like when professors got certain reviews
- notes should be shared, too (starts to integrate with [classroom](https://github.com/lowellbander/classroom))
- might need to implement some sort of currency to prevent against leechers, perhaps similar to the current UCLA system, but should probably be better ;)
- thumbnails of the test, perhaps even the first couple pages
- personal notes that the uploader has given, perhaps [proxy] contact information for the uploader if someone has a question at a later time
- popularity ratings for exams
- pretty as fuck
- public/private annotations
- requests for exams! then award points for people that satisfy the request?
